	<h1>Introduction to Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. In simpler terms, it quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run based on the size of its input. It is essential because it helps us understand how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases.Time complexity is often expressed using big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's running time concerning the input size. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) means that the time taken by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input. Similarly, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) indicates that the time taken grows quadratically with the input size, efficient algorithms typically have lower time complexity, meaning they can perform their tasks quickly even as the input size grows. Understanding time complexity is crucial for evaluating the performance of algorithms and selecting the most suitable one for a particular problem.</p>
	<p>Space complexity refers to the measure of the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute as a function of the input size. It quantifies the amount of memory consumed by an algorithm relative to the size of its input. Similar to time complexity, space complexity is essential for analyzing the performance of algorithms. <strong>Space Complexity</strong> is also often expressed using big O notation. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) indicates that it uses a linear amount of memory relative to the size of the input. This means that as the input size increases, the amount of memory required by the algorithm grows linearly.Understanding space complexity is vital, especially in scenarios where memory resources are limited, such as in embedded systems or when dealing with large datasets. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize space complexity while still achieving the desired functionality. By analyzing both time and space complexity, developers can make informed decisions about algorithm selection and optimization.</p>
